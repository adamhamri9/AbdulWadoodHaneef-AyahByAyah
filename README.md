# AbdulWadoodHaneef – Qur’an Verse By Verse Audio

This repository contains my work on **dividing the Qur’an into individual verses (Verse By Verse)** and organizing the corresponding **audio files for each verse** recited by AbdulWadood Haneef.

---

## Reflection

Working on this task reminds me of the immense effort required just to divide and align text and audio. It deepens my appreciation of the greatness of Allah who revealed it, and of the extraordinary patience of the Prophet ﷺ.

If organizing preserved text and sound is demanding, imagine the endurance required to receive, memorize, and convey it under the most challenging circumstances.

## Personal Note

During the course of this project, I faced **some health challenges** and had to undergo a medical procedure, which caused a temporary pause in my work for about a month. Alhamdulillah, I have now **resumed my efforts**.
