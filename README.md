As I work on segmenting the Qur’an into verses and processing its files, I realize the effort required just for this technical task. It reminds me of the greatness of the One who revealed it, and of the immense patience of the Prophet ﷺ. If we find it demanding to simply divide and align what is already preserved for us in text and sound, how remarkable was his endurance to receive it gradually over many years, memorize it, live by it, and convey it in the most difficult circumstances. This reflection deepens my certainty that the Qur’an is truly preserved by Allah and strengthens my love for the Prophet who carried it with such patience and devotion.
